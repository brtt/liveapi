# UPDATE 3/18/08 #

rob king reports that he's gotten LiveAPI working on OSX using popen since there's no sockets, although no code has been committed yet. He's still working on his thesis but I've poked him for the code.

marvotron has been added to project administrators and has some new stuff to commit to the tree from what I hear!

Also, I found this today.. a video of a Lemur controlling Live that uses LiveAPI..

I was really happy to see someone using our techniques and flexin' some skill. Big ups!
