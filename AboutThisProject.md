# Introduction #

This project was originally released back in March or so, 2007. I had a Joomla CMS setup which got phphaxed, so I've moved the project here.

I'm not currently doing any active development on it, but you're welcome to submit patches if you want. Just request to be added to the project by e-mailing googlecode@nym.hush.com with your google code email address.

I've added Rob King as a project administrator, I (nar) won't be pushing too much for future development, but will be participating if there's something I can do.
